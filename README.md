The application takes input data such as client details (name, email, project type, budget, etc.) and generates a professional and human-like email response based on that information.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-response-generator.git
cd smart-response-generator
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your environment variables:

Create a file named .env in the root directory.
Add your OpenAI API key to the file:
env
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
Running the Script
Open a terminal in the project directory.
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python auto_response.py
View the generated response in the terminal.
Understanding the .env File
The .env file is used to store sensitive information securely, such as the OpenAI API key. This approach keeps your key private and prevents accidental exposure when sharing or deploying code.

Example .env file:

env
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
Note: Never hard-code your API key in the script. Always use environment variables for security.

Directory Structure
bash
Copy code
smart-response-generator/
│
├── auto_response.py        # Main script for generating email responses
├── requirements.txt        # List of required dependencies
├── .env                    # Environment variables file (not included in the repo)
└── README.md               # Project documentation

How It Works
The script reads input client details from a predefined dictionary.
A prompt is constructed with these details and sent to OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model via API.
The model generates a professional email response, displayed in the terminal.
Error Handling
Invalid API Key: Ensures informative feedback if the API key is missing or invalid.
Quota Issues: Handles API quota limits gracefully by notifying the user.
Connection Errors: Captures and reports network or server-related issues.
