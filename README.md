The application takes input data such as client details (name, email, project type, budget, etc.) and generates a professional and human-like email response. It includes advanced features such as dynamic subject line generation, sender details integration, and feedback logging for iterative improvement.

Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-response-generator.git
cd smart-response-generator
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your environment variables:
Create a file named .env in the root directory.
Add your OpenAI API key and other sensitive information to the file:
env
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
Running the Script
Open a terminal in the project directory.
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python auto_response.py
View the generated response in the terminal.
Understanding the .env File
The .env file is used to securely store sensitive information like the OpenAI API key. This method keeps your key private and avoids accidental exposure during code sharing or deployment.

Example .env file:
env
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
Note: Never hard-code sensitive information like API keys in the script. Always use environment variables for enhanced security.

Directory Structure

How It Works
Dynamic Input Processing:

The script takes client details such as name, email, project type, budget, and additional information as input.
Dynamic Prompt Construction:

Constructs a detailed, context-aware prompt tailored to the client’s project requirements.
Response Generation:

Uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate a professional email response.
Dynamically includes a subject line and the sender's details.
Feedback Logging:

Logs feedback to the response_feedback.log file for future improvement and analysis.
Output:

Displays the generated response in the terminal.
Features
Dynamic Subject Line:

The subject line is dynamically constructed based on the client's project type (e.g., "Web Development Project Inquiry - Content with Databases").
Sender Details Integration:

Includes the sender's name, email, and role in the response, pulled dynamically from the configuration.
Feedback Logging:

Logs feedback on responses to a dedicated file (response_feedback.log), enabling iterative improvements.
Error Handling:

Invalid API Key: Detects and informs the user about missing or incorrect API keys.
Quota Issues: Notifies the user about API quota limits.
Connection Errors: Handles and reports network or server-related issues.
Security:

Environment variables ensure secure handling of sensitive information, such as API keys.
Example Workflow
Input:
Client Name: Geminas Ket
Client Email: GeminasKet@gmail.com
Project Type: Content with Databases
Budget: $100,000
Service Category: Web Development
Additional Information: "I need 4 dynamic pages for a real estate web application, with filters for 'for sale' and 'for rent.' Functionality only; design will be handled separately."
Output:

Subject: Web Development Project Inquiry - Content with Databases

Dear Geminas Ket,

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming web development project focusing on real estate content with databases. I appreciate the detailed overview of your requirements.

I understand that you are looking to create dynamic pages for apartments, houses, business centres, and land within a real estate web application. Your emphasis on the need for filters for 'for sale' and 'for rent' functionalities is duly noted. It’s great to hear that you have a clear vision for the functionality aspect, with design being handled separately.

Given the scope of the project and your budget of $100,000, I believe we can certainly deliver the required functionalities efficiently and effectively. I will work on putting together a tailored proposal that aligns with your specifications and budget.

I will reach out to you shortly with the detailed proposal outlining the project scope, timeline, and cost breakdown. If you have any additional details or specific preferences you would like to share in the meantime, please feel free to let me know.

Looking forward to the opportunity to collaborate on this project and bring your vision to life.

Warm regards,  
Rahul T K
